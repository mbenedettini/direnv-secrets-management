 # Enhancing developer experience with Direnv for secrets management

One thing that is usually problematic for every team is addressing the question of
how to provide each developer with environment variables that are sensitive in a way
that is not cumbersome to either set initial values or add new ones later on.

The setup in this repository is a proposal on how to handle them in a secure way
that is also effective and convenient for Engineers in the team.

## Technical details

We'll be using AWS Secrets Manager for this example but it could be easily adapted
to any other secrets management solution: Azure KeyVault, Hashicorp Vault, GCP Secret Manager.

As with other projects I'm relying on a combination of [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to pick up a script that performs most tasks (`.envrc`), and [Nix Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) to install required packages without polluting the entire OS.

## From Secrets to Env variables

We are assuming all secrets for our project are handled with AWS Secrets Manager but we don't want all of them to be brought into every local development environment, therefore only secrets with tag `dev-env=1` will be automatically pulled into environment variables.

Secret name will be converted into an environment variable name replacing `/` with `_` and making all letters upercase. For example secret `prod/db0/mariano` becomes env variable `PROD_DB0_MARIANO`.

All sensitive env variables are then stored into `.envrc-secrets`, which is in `.gitignore`.

## AWS cli setup

Some nice defaults have been already provisioned in `config-template` so that a new hire
only has to press enter a few times to go into the AWS SSO authorization process (we are
assumming an AWS account with the right access has been provisioned for them).

## See it in action

Here's a recording of how it would look for a newcomer to the project:

## What could be improved?

Right now every time the project directory is entered all secrets would get pulled and `.env-secrets` regenerated, a strategy to perform this only once a day with a way to manually
refresh when necessary would be a nice addition.
